# Odd One Out
Odd One Out is an engaging and educational children's app designed to enhance pattern recognition skills while providing hours of entertainment.

In this interactive game, young players are presented with a series of pictures featuring identical objects, except for one that is subtly different or "odd". Their mission? To identify the outlier in each level.
This challenge not only keeps kids entertained but enhances object recognition abilities and encourages attention to detail, and problem-solving.
